# Too large pull request

_This repo is forked from [noqcks/pull-request-size](https://github.com/noqcks/pull-request-size)._

This is a GitHub App that applies "large diff" label to Pull Requests those change more than 500 lines.

Here is an [example PR](https://github.com/eddiewentw/too-large-pull-request/pull/9). I push a commit that contains 501 lines changes. And APP added the label. After that, I deleted some codes. That label is removed by APP.

ยน A generated file is either one of the standard generated files as defined in [noqcks/generated](https://github.com/noqcks/generated/blob/master/lib/generated.js) or defined with `linguist-generated=true` in a `.gitattributes` file. See [Customizing how changed files appear on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/customizing-how-changed-files-appear-on-github/) for more information.
